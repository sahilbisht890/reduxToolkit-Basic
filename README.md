Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies state management in React apps by reducing boilerplate and providing powerful utilities for writing Redux logic efficiently.

ðŸ”¥ Why Use Redux Toolkit?
âœ… Less Boilerplate â€“ No need to write long switch-case reducers.
âœ… Built-in Immer â€“ Allows mutating state directly (under the hood, it converts mutations into immutable updates).
âœ… Better Performance â€“ Uses memoized selectors and optimized updates.
âœ… Async Logic Made Easy â€“ Comes with createAsyncThunk for handling API calls.
âœ… Best Practices Included â€“ Encourages feature-based slices instead of manually managing reducers.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
